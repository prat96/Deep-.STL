# Deep-.STL
Deep learning network to generate .STL models

This is just an idea I'd like to implement using Tensorflow 2.0

High-level view of the project:

Use libraries like numpy-stl to load many, many open source .STL models of objects, as np.array's.
Use this data to train an appropirately deep network.
Hopefully it should be able to generate it's own versions of certain .STL models!

TODO: Learn about Google-dream network and maybe adapt it to this project?
